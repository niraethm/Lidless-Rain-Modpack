Risk of Rain 2 Modpack for Lidless

_This is our first modpack so this also counts as a test on how to make a package for Thunderstore.io_

(This is a modpack made with the intention to be used by the Lidless group; however, feel free to try it out!)

We at Lidless have attempted to create an unholy abomination of a modpack that brings the chaotic fever dream of Risk of Rain 2 to a new high while trying to (somewhat) retain the spirit and feeling of the base game. 

Most modded features added in this modpack can be enabled or disabled in the game lobby, allowing you to customize your experience or to torture your friends with ever more insane combinations. Please, they won’t stop turning on the Artifact of Glass; Mithrix has broken my bones more times that I can count.

This pack contains a plethora of new items and modifiers, and with 13 modded survivors alongside the OG roster, Petricor V has never been more exciting. All of the added items fit neatly in with the vanilla game and SoTV, and serve to enhance the gameplay experience. Don’t like some of the items? No problem! You can disable specific items and equipment in the lobby screen! Maybe this way people will stop spamming Trophy Hunter! Ahoy!

Alongside the other nonsense comes more pain in the form of a greatly increased list of artifacts. We have lovingly named one playstyle of this pack “Chaos Mode” and that’s not even including the Artifact of Chaos! Why am I starting on Sky Meadows and what do you mean “a matriarchal fungus appears”? Mithrix still owes me $450 for all those McDonalds HappyMeals. Honestly, he’s terrible about paying people back. And don’t even get me started on the Newt. I feel like I’m getting robbed every time I go into his god-forsaken shop.

## Known Issues
- Artifact of Metamorphosis is incompatible with [Starstorm2](https://thunderstore.io/package/TeamMoonstorm/Starstorm2/). It will cause the camera to spawn under the map and no players will spawn. Please don't report this problem here, as this is only a modpack, not a mod itself.
